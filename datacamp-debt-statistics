SQL queries used in DataCamp Project to Analyze International Debt Statistics

Q1: Find the number of Distinct Countries

SELECT 
    COUNT (DISTINCT country_name) as total_distinct_countries
FROM international_debt;

Q2: Find the distinict debt indicators

SELECT DISTINCT(indicator_code) AS distinct_debt_indicators
FROM international_debt
ORDER BY distinct_debt_indicators;

Q3: Total the amount of debt owed by the countries. Divide it by 1000000 and round to two decimal places.

SELECT 
    ROUND(SUM(debt)/1000000, 2) AS total_debt
FROM international_debt; 

Q4: Country with the highest debt

SELECT 
   country_name,
    SUM(debt) AS total_debt
FROM international_debt
GROUP BY country_name
ORDER BY total_debt DESC
LIMIT 1;

Q5: Average amount of debt across indicators

SELECT 
    indicator_code AS debt_indicator,
    indicator_name,
    AVG(debt) AS average_debt
FROM international_debt
GROUP BY debt_indicator, indicator_name
ORDER BY average_debt DESC
LIMIT 10;

Q6: Find out which country owes the highest amount of debt in the category of long term debts (indicator_code DT.AMT.DLXF.CD).

SELECT
    country_name,
    indicator_name
FROM international_debt
WHERE debt = (SELECT MAX(debt) FROM international_debt WHERE indicator_code =  'DT.AMT.DLXF.CD');

Q7: The most common debt indicator code. We saw that long-term debt is the topmost category when it comes to the average amount of debt.
But is it the most common indicator in which the countries owe their debt?

SELECT
    indicator_code,
    COUNT(indicator_code) AS indicator_count
FROM international_debt
GROUP BY indicator_code
ORDER BY indicator_count DESC, indicator_code DESC
LIMIT 20;

Q8: Let's find out the maximum amount of debt that each country has. 

SELECT country_name, MAX(debt) AS maximum_debt
FROM international_debt
GROUP BY country_name
ORDER BY maximum_debt DESC
LIMIT 10;
